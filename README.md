# Vision-Based-Cruise-Control
Wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) are increasingly used in various applications, such as surveillance, transportation, and autonomous delivery systems. One of the critical challenges in developing WMRs is implementing effective cruise control systems that allow the robot to maintain a desired speed and trajectory while navigating through dynamic environments. This project focuses on developing a cruise control system for a WMR using camera feedback, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its speed and direction based on real-time visual information.
